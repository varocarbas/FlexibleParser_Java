# FlexibleParser (Java)

I will add these contents ASAP. 

For the time being you can take a look at the original C# versions resources (https://github.com/varocarbas/FlexibleParser), both versions are almost identical. You can know about the differences by comparing the respective test-file codes: [C#](https://github.com/varocarbas/FlexibleParser/blob/master/all_code/Test/Program.cs) and [Java](https://github.com/varocarbas/FlexibleParser_Java/blob/master/all_code/Test/src/Main.java)
