# FlexibleParser (Java)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/varocarbas/FlexibleParser_Java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/varocarbas/FlexibleParser_Java)

**NOTE: this is the conversion to Java of the original C# version stored in the [FlexibleParser repository](https://github.com/varocarbas/FlexibleParser).**

FlexibleParser is a multi-purpose parsing library based upon the following ideas:

- Intuitive, adaptable and easy to use.
- Pragmatic, but aiming for the maximum accuracy and correctness.
- Overall compatible and easily automatable. 
- Formed by independent DLLs managing specific situations.

## Parts

At the moment, FlexibleParser is formed by the following independent parts:

[UnitParser](https://customsolvers.com/unit_parser_java/) ([main code](https://github.com/varocarbas/FlexibleParser_Java/tree/master/all_code/UnitParser), [test code](https://github.com/varocarbas/FlexibleParser_Java/blob/master/all_code/Test/src/Parts/UnitParser.java), [readme file](https://github.com/varocarbas/FlexibleParser_Java/blob/master/all_readme/UnitParser_Java.md))<br/>
It allows to easily deal with a wide variety of situations involving units of measurement.
Among its most salient features are: user-defined exception triggering and gracefully managing numeric values of any size.
