# FlexibleParser (Java)

I will add these contents ASAP. 

For the time being, you can take a look at the original C# code (https://github.com/varocarbas/FlexibleParser), which is almost identical. The easiest way to know about the differences between both versions by comparing the corresponding test codes: [C#](https://github.com/varocarbas/FlexibleParser/blob/master/all_code/Test/Program.cs) and [Java](https://github.com/varocarbas/FlexibleParser_Java/blob/master/all_code/Test/src/Main.java)
